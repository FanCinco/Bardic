## Description
  Have you ever find it difficult to decide what app/system to use when planning a trip? Or perhaps you already have a way to plan things, record your expenses and share stories but is it all in one place? Do you sometimes forget what logins you used or even where your information is stored because it is all over the internet?
  
  If that's your case, then we have a solution for you! Our web app BARDIC is designed to facilitate all of your travel needs all in one single place! You'll have the ability to not only decide where to go on a trip; but also a place to record your daily expenses and share stories with your travel group, without switching websites!

    Of course there are always things you need to pay for on a trip. To keep track of all that, we have included a tab to help you record and see all the things you have paid for.
