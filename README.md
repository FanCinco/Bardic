## Description
  Have you ever find it hard to find the right app/system to use when planning a trip? Or perhaps you already have a way to plan things, record your expenses and share stories but is it all in one place? Do you sometimes forget what logins you used or even where your information is stored because it is all over the place?
  
  If this is your case, then we have a solution for you! Our web app is designed to facilitate all of your travel needs all in one single place! You'll have the ability to not only decide where to go, but also a place to record your daily expenses and share stories with your travel group; without needing to switch websites!
